# Quickly Create PHP Projects

Leaf is a PHP framework that helps you create clean, simple but powerful web apps and APIs quickly. Leaf introduces a cleaner and much simpler structure to the PHP language while maintaining it's flexibility. With a simple structure and a shallow learning curve, it's an excellent way to rapidly build powerful and high performant web apps and APIs.üí™

# What's new in v2.0?

## Leaf Container
Leaf 2.0 introduces a container as the core of Leaf. This container allows you to use some core packages from leaf without haaving to instanciate them. In previous versions, every single package needed to be initialised. 

This container also allows you to register custom/external packages on the current leaf instance for global use with `$leaf->register()`

```js
$leaf = new Leaf\App();

// register a new package
$leaf->register("purple", function() {
	return new Purple\Leaf();
});

$leaf->get("/home", function() use($leaf) {
	// use the purple package
	$something = $leaf->purple->doSomething();
	$leaf->response->respond($something);
});
```

## Leaf Mail
A new simple package added to Leaf in v2. Leaf Mail takes out all the stress associated with Mailing. It is built on the powerful PHPMailer library but offers an improved and better experience for developers

```js
$mail = new Leaf\Mail('smtp.gmail.com', 587, [
	'username' => 'user@gmail.com', 
	'password' => '*********'
]);

$mail->write([
	"subject" => "Email Subject",
	"template" => "./template.html",
	"recepient_email" => "receiver@mail.com",
	"sender_name" => "Leaf PHP Framework",
	"attachment" => "./../README.MD"
]);

$mail->send();
```

## More concise DB Methods
More db methods have been added to Leaf's db packages. These methods provide a simpler and a much more concise way of interacting with your database. Also, the mysqli package has been directly integrated into Leaf core, so you can use it globally without having to instanciate it yourself.

```js
$leaf = new Leaf\App();
$form = new Leaf\Form();

// db connection
$leaf->db->connect("host", "username", "password", "dbname");

$leaf->post("/articles/add", function() use($leaf) {
	// validate, check for a duplicate identifier and insert the data into 
	// database.articles, it's sanitised and arranged automatically
	$leaf->db->add("articles", $leaf->request->getBody(), ["identifier"], false, [
		"title" => "text",
		"author" => "ValidUsername",
		"email" => "email",
		"description" => "text",
		"identifier" => "number"
	]);

	// return json encoded data
	$leaf->response->respond(
		// fetch all articles belonging to an author
		$leaf->db->choose("articles", "*", [
			"author" => $leaf->request->get("author")
		])->fetchAll()
	);
});
```

## Major Security Fixes
Leaf 2.0 offers full protection from common web app security vulnerabilities like XSS. In Leaf v2, all input is automatically sanitized to make sure no weird scripts get into your application. Let's look at this example.

Considering we have a script `<script>alert("hello");</script>`, we pass this script as a parameter into our app in a post request.

```javascript
$leaf->post('/users/update', function() use($leaf) {
	// without leaf
	echo $_POST["param"];
});
```
In this case, the script is run and the XSS attack is successful.

```javascript
$leaf->post('/users/update', function() use($leaf) {
	// using leaf
	echo $leaf->request->get("param");
});
```
In this case the script is just output to the user as a string.
